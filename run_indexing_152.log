- This IS expected if you are initializing ColBERT from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPretraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing ColBERT from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of ColBERT were not initialized from the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['linear.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

and will be removed in future. Use torchrun.
Note that --use_env is set by default in torchrun.
If your script expects `--local_rank` argument to be set, please
change it to read from `os.environ['LOCAL_RANK']` instead. See
